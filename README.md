# Github Finder Basic App

This is a bare bones React JS app that searches and displays users from the GitHub API. It is meant as an example of basic React JS competency.

## API Implementatioon

The Github API is accessed using the axios libraries

## Component Implementation

The components are created using class-based components. Function-based components using hooks and context will be part of a separate demo app.

## State management

There is no state management implementation, such as Context API or Redux, used in this example.
